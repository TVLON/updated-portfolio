      <img src="Talon1.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

				<p>As of right now I work at US Foods up in Ogden. I am a night warehouse order selector for USfoods and I am excited to move on to something more challenging. I have gained valuable knowledge through the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp and I am anticipating the great opportunities that follow.</p>
